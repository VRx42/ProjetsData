## Data Exploration

[42](https://www.42.fr) is a private, non-profit and tuition-free **engineering and programming school** based on **peer-to-peer learning** and **hands-on projects**. It offers a flexible 3-5 years self-paced and tuition-free curriculum.

42's educational model is qualified as innovative and is unlike any other program: **no teachers, courses or classes, no tuition, no fees and no grades required to enter the school**. The only admission requirements are to be 18+ years old and then to complete the entrance examination: *'la Piscine'*.

A Piscine (i.e *'swimming pool'* in French) is a 4-week intensive and immersive coding bootcamp, 7 days a week, 15 hours a day. No previous programming experience required. 900 applicants learn C programming and bash scripting through daily exercises. Selected candidates (approx. 200) can register to be full-time students at 42, a tuition-free engineering school.
